Zack Deacon Homework -- Quiz homework

I have created a quiz on soccer related questions. 

i used javascript to manipulate divs and navigate through the quiz. There is a timer and as you answeer questions incorrectly the time is decremented. the time you have left when the quiz is complete is your score. your score is stored in local storage that you can use to compare with your friends. 

Enjoy!
